# SPEC-001: Accessible Learning Platform for the Visually Impaired

## Background
The traditional educational content relies heavily on visual elements, which are challenging for visually impaired individuals. This platform aims to provide essential accessibility features to make educational content more inclusive using CV and RAG technologies.

## Requirements

### Must-Haves
1. **Basic Image Analysis:**
   - Use CV to analyze images and convert them to descriptive text.
2. **Basic Text Generation:**
   - Use RAG to generate descriptions for analyzed images.
3. **Voice Integration:**
   - Provide text-to-speech functionality for generated descriptions.
4. **Simple User Interface:**
   - Ensure basic accessibility features like screen reader support.

### Should-Haves
1. **Basic Content Management:**
   - Allow users to upload images.
2. **User Profiles:**
   - Enable basic user registration and login.

### Won't-Haves
1. **Video Analysis:**
   - Focus only on image analysis for the MVP.
2. **Interactive Q&A Support:**
   - This will be postponed for future development.

## Method
We'll use Vercel's Next.js for the front end, our own LLMs for text and voice, and a simplified CV model for image analysis. Additionally, we will integrate AI and OpenAI libraries, Husky for pre-commit styling, and utilize the following resources:
- [oobabooga/text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) for text generation and RAG.
- [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) for image analysis.
- OpenAI API for text-to-voice functionality.
